WriteADoc uses common Markdown syntax with some extensions. This section is a showcase of all the supported syntax.


## Setting the page title, description, etc.

Each page must have a title, which is used in the navigation sidebar, the search, and in other places.
To set it, at the beginning of each of your pages, add a setion surrounded by `---`, like this:

```md
---
title: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
---

You don't have
```
