WriteADoc uses common Markdown syntax with some extensions. This section showcases all the supported syntax.

## Setting the page title, description, etc.

Each page must have a title, which is used in the navigation sidebar, search, and other places.
To set it, add a section surrounded by `---` at the beginning of each of your pages, like this:

```md
---
title: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
---

You don't have
```
